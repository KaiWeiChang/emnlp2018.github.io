Dates and locations for each workshop will be added soon. Please refer to each individual event's website for more details.

### CoNLL: The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning
[CoNLL](http://www.conll.org) is a top-tier conference, yearly organized by SIGNLL (ACL's Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning).  

### WMT18: The Third Conference on Machine Translation
The [WMT18](http://www.statmt.org/wmt18/) conference builds on a series of annual workshops and conferences on statistical machine translation, going back to 2006.

### LOUHI: The Ninth International Workshop on Health Text Mining and Information Analysis
LOUHI 2018 provides an interdisciplinary forum for researchers interested in automated processing of health documents.

### BioASQ: Large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering
The aim of [the BioASQ workshop](http://bioasq.org/workshop) is to push the research frontier towards systems that use the diverse and voluminous information available online to respond directly to the information needs of biomedical scientists.

### Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP
The goal of [this workshop](https://blackboxnlp.github.io) is to bring together people who are attempting to peek inside the neural network black box, taking inspiration from machine learning, psychology, linguistics and neuroscience. 

### FEVER: First Workshop on Fact Extraction and VERification
The [FEVER workshop](https://sheffieldnlp.github.io/fever/) brings together researchers working on various tasks related to fact extraction and verification and also hosts the FEVER Challenge, an information verification shared task.

### ARGMINING: 5th International Workshop on Argument Mining
The goal of the [ArgMining workshop](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/Workshops/argmining17/) is to provide a continuing forum to the last four yearsâ€™ Argumentation Mining workshops at ACL and NAACL, the first research forum devoted to argumentation mining in all domains of discourse.

### ALW2: Second Workshop on Abusive Language Online
The last few years have seen a surge in abusive online behavior, with governments, social media platforms, and individuals struggling to cope with the consequences and to produce effective methods to combat it. The [ALW2 workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/alw2018) bring researchers of various disciplines together to discuss approaches to abusive language. 

### W-NUT: 4th Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text
The WNUT workshop focuses on Natural Language Processing applied to noisy user-generated text, such as that found in social media, online reviews, crowdsourced data, web forums, clinical records and language learner essays. 

### SCAI: Search-Oriented Conversational AI
The [SCAI workshop](http://scai.info) aims to bring together AI/Deep Learning specialists on one hand and search/IR specialists on the other hand to lay the ground for search-oriented conversational AI and establish future directions and collaborations.

### UDW: Second Workshop on Universal Dependencies
[The Universal Dependencies Workshop](http://universaldependencies.org/udw18/) invites papers on all topics relevant to universal dependencies. Priority will be given to papers that adopt a cross-lingual perspective.

### SIGMORPHON: Fifteenth Workshop on Computational Research in Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology
[This workshop](https://sigmorphon.github.io) organized by the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Morphology and Phonology provides a forum for exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in computational morphology and phonology.

### WASSA: 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis
The aim of the WASSA workshop is to continue the line of the previous editions, bringing together researchers in Computational Linguistics working on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text.

### SMM4H: 3rd Social Media Mining for Health Applications Workshop & Shared Task
[The SMM4H workshop](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h/) seeks to attract researchers interested in automatic methods for the collection, extraction, representation, analysis, and validation of social media data for health informatics. It serves as a unique forum to discuss novel approaches to text and data mining methods that are applicable to social media data and may prove invaluable for health monitoring and surveillance.
