    title: "Julia Hirschberg"
    small_excerpt: 'Julia Hirschberg is Percy K. and Vida L. W. Hudson Professor and Chair of Computer Science at [Columbia University](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/). She previously worked at Bell Laboratories and AT&T Labs where she created the HCI Research Department.  She served on the Association for Computational Linguistics executive board (1993-2003), the International Speech Communication Association board (1999-2007; 2005-7 as president), the International Conference on Spoken Language Processing board (1996--), the NAACL executive board (2012-15), the CRA Executive Board (2013-14), and the AAAI Council (2012-15).  She has been editor of Computational Linguistics and Speech Communication, is a fellow of AAAI, ISCA, ACL, ACM, and IEEE, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.  She received the IEEE James L. Flanagan Speech and Audio Processing Award and the ISCA Medal for Scientific Achievement. She currently serves on the IEEE Speech and Language Processing Technical Committee, is co-chair of the CRA-W Board, and has worked for diversity for many years at AT&T and Columbia.  She works on spoken language processing and NLP, studying text-to-speech synthesis, spoken dialogue systems, entrainment in conversation, detection of deceptive and emotional speech, hedging behavior, and linguistic code-switching (language mixing).'

    title: "Gideon Mann"
    small_excerpt: 'Gideon Mann is the Head of Data Science at Bloomberg L.P., where he guides the strategic direction for machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and search across the company.  He is part of the leadership team for the Office of the CTO. He served as a founding member of both the [Data for Good Exchange](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/) (D4GX), an annual conference on data science applications for social good, and the [Shift Commission on Work, Workers and Technology](https://shiftcommission.work). He has also been active in academic research in fact extraction, weakly-supervised learning, and distributed optimization. Recently, he has also been interested in applications of machine learning to problems in software engineering. From 2007 to 2014, he worked at Google Research in New York City, and his team built core machine learning libraries, released the Google Prediction API, and developed [Colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com). Mann graduated Brown University in 1999 and received a Ph.D. from The Johns Hopkins University in 2006.'
johan:

    alt: "Johan Bos"
    title: "Johan Bos"
    small_excerpt: 'Johan Bos is Professor of Computational Semantics at the University of Groningen (Netherlands). He received his doctorate from the Computational Linguistics Department at the University of the Saarland (Germany) and held post-doc positions at the University of Edinburgh (UK) and the La Sapienza University in Rome (Italy). In 2010, he moved to his current position in Groningen, leading the computational semantics group. Bos is the developer of Boxer, a state-of-the-art wide-coverage semantic parser for English, initiator of the [Groningen Meaning Bank](http://gmb.let.rug.nl), a large semantically-annotated corpus of texts, and inventor of Wordrobe, a game with a purpose for semantic annotation. Bos received a $1.5-million Vici grant from NWO (Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research) in 2015 to investigate the role of meaning in human and machine translation. A concrete outcome of this project is the [Parallel Meaning Bank](http://pmb.let.rug.nl) containing detailed meaning representations for English, German, Dutch and Italian sentences.'
