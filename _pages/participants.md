## Accommodation

Through our official housing partner, the Brussels Booking Desk, we are able to provide reduced hotel rates for the EMNLP Conference. Book through the simple-to-use reservation website or with helpful and friendly booking agents.
 

Please note that the Brussels Booking Desk is the *only* official housing company associated with KU Leuven. While other hotel resellers may contact you to offer accommodation for your trip, they are not endorsed by, or affiliated with the event and entering into financial agreements with such companies can have costly consequences.
 

You can book a room in the following ways:
1.  [Online](https://secure.hotel.visitbrussels.be/event/emnlp-2018/congress/search)
2.  By sending an [email request](mailto:c.viaene@brusselsbookingdesk.be) to the Brussels Booking Desk.
3.  By calling the Brussels Booking Desk at 0032 2 552 00 05 (Monday to Friday, during office hours, CMT) and speaking with Charlotte Viaene.
 

**Note that the official hotel event rates will begin to expire on Tuesday, September 18th, 2018**.
